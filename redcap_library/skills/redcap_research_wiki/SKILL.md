# RedCap Research Wiki

## Load Contracts

1. Read `redcap_research_wiki/governance.md`.
2. Read `redcap_research_wiki/index.md`.
3. Read the target project's `project_plan.md` and `agent_rules.md`.
4. Read only the source records and pages required by the active question.
5. Read `redcap_library/redcap_doc_writer_skill/SKILL.md` only for an approved documentation-sync operation.
6. Resolve `validate_redcap_research_wiki` from `redcap_library/bash_tool/registry.json`.

Do not bulk-read historical PDFs or logs. Do not execute direct shell commands from this skill.
Write all authored prose, result envelopes, and templates in English. Preserve
raw titles, repository paths, commands, symbols, markers, and direct evidence
fragments verbatim.

## Select One Operation

| Operation | Required input | Required output |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest` | One bounded source pack | Source record and proposed affected pages |
| `query` | One research question | Cited answer, claim boundary, and optional page proposal |
| `decide` | Question, sources, configuration, markers | Completed simulator decision contract |
| `sync-docs` | Human-approved wiki conclusion and target docs | Existing bilingual documentation proposal |
| `lint` | Wiki root | Registered validator result and review findings |
| `capture-triage` | One completed bounded operation | `none`, `log`, `update-page`, `case-draft`, or `decision-contract` |

Reject mixed operations. Complete one bounded operation, report it, then accept the next task.

## Ingest

1. Verify every source path and locator.
2. Search the index before creating a page.
3. Register the source without copying raw content.
4. Update an existing page when the material corrects or extends an existing concept.
5. Label every technical claim using the governance labels.
6. Keep new or changed synthesis `review-required`.
7. Update `index.md` and append an ingest entry to `log.md`.
8. Invoke `validate_redcap_research_wiki`.

## Query

1. Read the index and the smallest relevant page set.
2. Follow `source_refs` to authoritative sources when the answer depends on exact wording, current status, or runtime evidence.
3. Separate source statements, runtime observations, source traces, and inference.
4. Return `[Needs Verification]` when evidence is missing or ambiguous.
5. Propose a new page only when the answer will be reused.

## Decide

1. Start from `decisions/simulator-decision-contract.md`.
2. Fill every field before implementation or runtime execution.
3. Classify source endpoints as implemented/called, partial, dormant, definition-only, or missing.
4. Stop when the requested metric or markers cannot support the intended claim.
5. Return the contract as L3 `NEEDS_REVIEW`; do not start L4 work without explicit approval.

## Capture Triage

1. Classify the completed bounded operation as `none`, `log`, `update-page`,
   `case-draft`, or `decision-contract`.
2. Select `case-draft` only for a reusable finding with verifiable sources or
   evidence and a future consumer.
3. Use `cases/case-template.md` for a case draft; preserve `draft` or
   `review-required` until human review.
4. Use `decision-contract` before source modification or runtime execution.
5. Append a `capture` entry to `log.md` for the result.

## Synchronize Documentation

1. Require an approved wiki page with `status: confirmed`.
2. Use `redcap_library/redcap_doc_writer_skill/SKILL.md` for existing README and stable-document rules.
3. Update English and Traditional Chinese public pages together.
4. Preserve historical reports and their original evidence paths.
5. Invoke the registered documentation checker that owns the changed route.

## Lint

1. Invoke `validate_redcap_research_wiki`.
2. Report broken paths, missing metadata, unsupported labels, orphans, contradictions, and stale claims separately.
3. Propose mechanical fixes only. Never promote semantic content automatically.

## Return
